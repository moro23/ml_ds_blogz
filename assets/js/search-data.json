            "content": "Machine learning (ML) . Machine learning involves giving a system a set of input and output data, which then transforms the data into a model (code), that is used to make intelligent decisions. This process compared to the Traditional Software development process which involves a person first finding patterns in the data and then writing code to convert the data to the desired outcome using the manual discovery patterns. . The Machine learning Process . The ML process involves the use of the Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRIS-DM), which is a step-by-step methodology for implementing a successful machine learning project. The ML process is made up of six steps, namely; . Business understanding: This stage of the ML process involves identifying the problem, how to solve the problem, and whether machine learning will be a useful tool for solving it. . | Data understanding: This stage is where the available dataset is analysed and a decision is made whether to collect more data. . | Data preparation: At this stage of the ML process, the data is transformed into a tabular form which can be used as input for a machine learning model. . | Modelling: This stage of the ML process deals with training of models. In order words, where data is fed to an algorithm to discover patterns in the data. . | Evaluation: At this stage of the ML process, the performance of the model is evaluated to see if the model solves the original business problem. . | Deployment: The final stage of the ML process is where the model is deployed to production based on the results of the evaluation. . |",

            "content": "Before training a machine learning (ML) model, the dataset is divided into training, validation, and testing sets. This process of dividing the dataset is also known as building a validation framework. . In an ideal situation, the dataset is normally divided into these sets and hence one can continue with the other data preprocessing steps and then proceed to training the mode. . In a situation where the dataset has not been divided into these sets, the best method to use a means of building a validation framework is Cross Validation. Cross Validation is the process of splitting the dataset into Training and Testing set in an unbiased format. . The Steps For Using Cross Validation In Building A Validation Framework is as follows: . Step 1: Randomly divide the data into different groups (n). . Step 2: Use (n-1) group for training the model and the last group for testing. . Step 3: The process is repeated for n number of iterations which is called n-Fold Cross validation. . Notes . The number of iterations are called Folds. . The method of Cross Validation that is used in a situation where we have lots of data is the 10-Fold cross validation which is the preferred algorithm method. . Another method for Cross Validation is the Leave-One-Out Cross Validation. Which is used in a situation where we are dealing with less amount of data. . Lastly, one of the important reasons for building a validation framework is to avoid Data Leakage. Which occurs when the same data used for training a model is also used for testing the model. .
