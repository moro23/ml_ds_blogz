            "content": "Before training a machine learning (ML) model, the dataset is divided into training, validation, and testing sets. This process of dividing the dataset is also known as building a validation framework. . In an ideal situation, the dataset is normally divided into these sets and hence one can continue with the other data preprocessing steps and then proceed to training the mode. . In a situation where the dataset has not been divided into these sets, the best method to use a means of building a validation framework is Cross Validation. Cross Validation is the process of splitting the dataset into Training and Testing set in an unbiased format. . The Steps For Using Cross Validation In Building A Validation Framework is as follows: . Step 1: Randomly divide the data into different groups (n). . Step 2: Use (n-1) group for training the model and the last group for testing. . Step 3: The process is repeated for n number of iterations which is called n-Fold Cross validation. . Notes . The number of iterations are called Folds. . The method of Cross Validation that is used in a situation where we have lots of data is the 10-Fold cross validation which is the preferred algorithm method. . Another method for Cross Validation is the Leave-One-Out Cross Validation. Which is used in a situation where we are dealing with less amount of data. . Lastly, one of the important reasons for building a validation framework is to avoid Data Leakage. Which occurs when the same data used for training a model is also used for testing the model. .
